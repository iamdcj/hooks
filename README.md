# Hooks

Hooks provide stateful components, without needing to use classes.

Prior to the advent of Hooks, `function` components were used for presentation purposes, and classes were used when working with state/logic. In a nutshell, **hooks add state to functional components.**

## Benefits

Hooks provide a number of benefits which you don't currently get with 'stateful' class components, including;

- **Cleaner components** - hooks provides a way for related logic to be grouped in sensible methods, opposed to the prescribed lifecycle methods bundled into React `class` components. 

- **A better way for sharing functionality** - stateful logic can be taken away from components, providing easier reuse and testability. Classes handled all logic directly in the component.
