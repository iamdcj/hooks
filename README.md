# Hooks

Hooks provide stateful components, without needing to use `class`es.

Prior to the advent of Hooks, `function`al components were used for presentation purposes, and `class`es were used to working with state/logic. **Hooks add state to functional components.**

## Benefits

Hooks provide a number of benefits which you don't currently get with 'stateful' `class`es:

- **Cleaner components** - hooks provides a way for related logic to be grouped in sensible methods, opposed to the prescribed lifecycle methods bundled in with `class` components. And, `class`es can confuse.

- **A better way for sharing functionality** - stateful logic can be taken away from components, providing easier reuse and testability.
